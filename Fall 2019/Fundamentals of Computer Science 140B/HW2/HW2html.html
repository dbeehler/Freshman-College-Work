    <img id="pics" src="duck.jpg" alt="this is a jumping duck">
    <ul>
      <li>this is one of my favorite pictures</li>
      <li>The duck was following its mother</li>
      <li>The only way was up the stairs</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="squirrel.jpg" alt="A squirrel">
    <ul>
      <li>The squirrel seems very happy in this photo</li>
      <li>I kept feeing him so I could gain his trust</li>
      <li>Once he sat still I was able to capture this image</li>
